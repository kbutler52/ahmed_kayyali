count =1 #This is what count started out as
while count<=7:# this is saying while count is less than or equal to 7
    if count % 2==0:# this is saying if the remainder of count divided by 2 is equal to zero.
        print (count) #then print count
    count+=1#this says count=count +1; this is the counter
